                The labs for CIS 3344 revolve around using HTML and CSS to create and style webpages.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <h3>
                My personal experience in using HTML and CSS is pretty shallow with a basic understanding
                of a few key topics in page layout and styling techniques.
                <br>
                <br>
                Some of the techniques I used include setting background and text colors to make the page
                look nice along with using absoulte postioning on several "divs" to
                seperate the different sections of my page layout.
                <br>
                <br>
                I enjoyed being able to style everything how I wanted but had some issues using
                floats to get everything where I planned.
